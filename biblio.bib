abstract={We study here some integral equations linked to the Laplace or the Helmholtz equation, or to the system of elasticity equations. These equations lead to non integrable kernels only defined as finite parts, so that they are quite difficult to approximate. In each case, we introduce a variational formulation which avoids this difficulty and allow us to use stable finite element approximations for these problems},

	Abstract = {We model the electrical behavior of several biological cells under external stimuli by ex-
tending and computationally improving the semi-implicit multiple traces formulation presented in
(Henr´ıquez et al., Numerische Mathematik, 2016). Therein, the electric potential and current for a
single cell are retrieved through the coupling of boundary integral operators and non-linear ordinary
differential systems of equations. Yet, the low-order discretization scheme presented becomes imprac-
tical when accounting for interactions among multiple cells. In this note, we consider multi-cellular
systems and show existence and uniqueness of the resulting non-linear evolution problem in finite time.
Our main tools are analytic semigroup theory along with mapping properties of boundary integral
operators in Sobolev spaces. Thanks to the smoothness of cellular shapes, solutions are highly regu-
lar at a given time. Hence, spectral spatial discretization can be employed, thereby largely reducing
the number of unknowns. Time-space coupling is achieved via a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme
shown to be stable and convergent. Numerical results in two dimensions validate our claims and match
observed biological behavior for the Hodgkin-Huxley dynamical model.},

	Abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) crack problems are solved employing a novel technique based on a combination of wavelet Galerkin method and X-FEM with a high-order interpolant. Multiresolution analysis of the wavelet basis functions (scaling/wavelet functions) plays an important role in the numerical simulation. High-order B-spline scaling/wavelet functions are chosen as the basis functions. Severe stress concentration near a crack tip is represented by superposing the multiresolution wavelet functions. In addition, the crack modeling is easy to treat by introducing enrichment functions of the X-FEM. In the proposed approach, the governing equation is discretized based on fixed grid, and fracture mechanics problems with complicated shaped geometries can be analyzed effectively, reducing the model generation tasks. 2D linear fracture mechanics problems are solved, and the accuracy is studied for numerical examples.},

	Abstract = {The problem of determining a crack by overspecified boundary data is considered. When complete data are available on the external boundary, a reciprocity gap concept is introduced. This concept formalizes the comparison of the response of the safe body to the response of the cracked one of the same physical characteristics. If the crack is known (or assumed) to be planar, explicit inversion formulae are derived determining the host plane equation and the length of an emerging crack in two-dimensional (2D) situations. A reciprocity gap functional is designed and exploited to establish a complete identification result. Numerical trials of the identification methods proposed show very good accuracies and insignificant computational costs.},

Under the assumption of local finite energy we show the equivalence of the integral equations and the original boundary value problems. Via the Wiener-Hopf method in the halfspace, localization and the calculus of pseudodifferential operators we derive existence, uniqueness and regularity results for the solution of our boundary integral equations together with its explicit behavior near the edge of the screen. We give Galerkin schemes based on our integral equations on S and obtain high convergence rates by using special singular elements besides regular splines as test and trial functions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The solution of the three-dimensional mixed boundary value problem for the Laplacian in a polyhedral domain has special singular forms at corners and edges. A `tensor-product' decomposition of those singular forms along the edges is derived. We present a strongly elliptic system of boundary integral equations which is equivalent to the mixed boundary value problem. Regularity results for the solution of this system of integral equations are given which allow us to analyse the influence of graded meshes on the rate of convergence of the corresponding boundary element Galerkin solutions. We show that it suffices to refine the mesh only towards the edges of the surfaces to regain the optimal rate of convergence.},

 abstract = {Consider solving the Dirichlet problem $$\Delta u(P) = 0, P \in \mathbb R^2\backslash S,$$ $$u(P) = h(P),\quad P \in S,$$ $$\sup|u(P)| < \infty,$$ $$P \in \Bbb{R}^2$$ with $S$ a smooth open curve in the plane. We use single-layer potentials to construct a solution $u(P)$. This leads to the solution of equations of the form $$\int_S g(Q) \log|P - Q|dS(Q) = h(P), \quad P \in S.$$ This equation is reformulated using a special change of variable, leading to a new first-kind equation with a smooth solution function. This new equation is split into a principal part, which is explicitly invertible, and a compact perturbation. Then a discrete Galerkin method that takes special advantage of the splitting of the integral equation is used to solve the equation numerically. A complete convergence analysis is given; numerical examples conclude the paper.},

We prove that the number of multiplications used in generating the compressed matrix is O(nlog3n), and the solution of the proposed method preserves the optimal convergence order O(n−t), where n is the order of the Fourier basis functions used in the method and t denotes the degree of regularity of the exact solution. Moreover, we propose a preconditioning which ensures the numerical stability when solving the preconditioned linear system. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical estimates and to demonstrate the approximation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

abstract = "This paper is devoted to the solution of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace and Helmholtz equation in the complement of a smooth open curve in the plane. The solution is looked for as a single-layer potential, the corresponding density being therefore the solution of an integral equation on the open arc. This equation is transformed into an equivalent 1-periodic integral equation having existence and uniqueness of solution for any periodic data. Here we study the use of collocation and quadrature methods for solving this equation. We show the convergence of both methods and prove the existence of an asymptotic expansion of the error in powers of the discretization parameter. As a consequence we show that for some of them a superconvergence phenomenon occurs when computing the solution of the differential problem. Two numerical experiments are shown in order to illustrate the theoretical results introduced in this work."
